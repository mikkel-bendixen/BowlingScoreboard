# BowlingScoreboard
I will be using TDD to implement a bowling scoreboard. The goal is to create a system that can accurately calculate the score of a bowling game based on the rules of ten-pin bowling.
I will be starting out with a simple interface that allows the user to input the number of pins knocked down in each roll, and then calculate the score based on that input.

### System Design
For a start i will only design an interface that allows the user to input the number of pins knocked down.
Then it should be possible to see the number of pins knocked down on each roll in each frame, as well as the total score for each frame and the total score for the overall game.

I will not decide on a specific design upfront, except for above mentioned interface, but will let the design evolve as I implement the functionality using TDD.
I will start out with a very simple solution and then refactor as needed to improve the design.
